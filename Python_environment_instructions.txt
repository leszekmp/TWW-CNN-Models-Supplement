To run the Single Sherd Analyzer (SSA) Jupyter notebook for evaluation:

1. You must have Python installed on your system. We use Anaconda, but you should be able to use any Python environment system you wish.

2. Program was developed on Python 3.7. Should work on later versions, but no guarantees.

3. Create a separate Python virtual environment in which to run the notebook.

4. Activate the Python environment, and use the included requirements.txt file to install all required packages with the versions used in development. Use pip to install with the command:

pip install -r requirements.tx

Do not install libraries with Anaconda package manager; doesn't work well.

5. Unzip Single Sherd Analyzer files/folder into desired location.

6. Start Python in SSA folder, activate environment created in step 3.

7. Run Jupyter notebook with command:

jupyter notebook

Jupyter should start in your default browser.

8. Select "Single_Sherd_8_Analyzer.ipynb" from file list to start notebook.

9. Run top section of code to initialize analyzer, then follow directions in comments.

10. Program was developed in Windows; running it in Linux or Mac may require modifying some of the file paths.
